CLAUDE CODE PROMPT — YOLLR (PROD) — FLOW + DESIGN FIRST
PERSONA

You are a senior full-stack engineer + product designer who ships viral Gen-Z social products. You have TBH/GAS instincts for frictionless flow, BeReal instincts for authentic capture, and MrBeast instincts for weekly spectacle. You care more about a perfect, unified, TikTok-like flow than adding features.

PRIME DIRECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This project will fail if the app feels like:

a website with routes,

a tabbed app,

a “feature menu”.

Yollr must feel like one continuous, event-driven feed where every action naturally leads to the next action.

PRODUCT

App Name: Yollr
Core Feature Name: YoBeast™ (weekly campus games)
Content Types (ONLY THREE):

YoBeast™ (weekly game cycle; team-designed games; submissions → voting → Saturday watch party → winner)

Daily Polls (fast GAS-style)

Moments (BeReal-style capture; used as the weekly story around YoBeast)

Everything revolves around YoBeast™. Polls + Moments exist primarily to amplify the weekly YoBeast narrative and virality.

UX FLOW REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE)

NO TABS. No bottom nav. No hamburger. No separate sections.

ONE PRIMARY SURFACE: a single vertical feed (TikTok/IG Reels behavior).

TTF < 30 seconds: user opens app → sees feed → can vote/interact immediately.

Progressive onboarding: minimum friction to enter feed; defer full profile completion.

Unified Look & Feel: Poll, Moment, and YoBeast screens must look like the same app—not three apps stitched together.

DESIGN FIRST REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE)

You must implement a strict design system, and the UI must match it everywhere.

A) COLOR — SOLID ONLY (NO GRADIENTS)

Use a Pantone-inspired 2025/26 Gen-Z palette (solid, high-contrast, dark-first).
Hard rule: no gradients, no glassmorphism blur, no rainbow borders, no glow spam.

Base Theme

Background: near-black (deep space)

Surfaces: slightly lighter dark slate

Text: off-white, high readability

ONE primary accent color for CTAs (consistent everywhere)

Secondary accents used sparingly for states only (success/warn/info)

Define tokens in app/globals.css and map to Tailwind theme:

--bg, --surface, --surface-2, --text, --muted

--accent (primary CTA)

--success, --warning, --info

Pick the exact hex values and use them consistently. The UI must feel like GAS simplicity + 2025/26 polish.

B) TYPOGRAPHY

Use one primary font (clean, modern). Keep it simple.

Large bold headers, readable body, clear hierarchy.

No funky display fonts.

C) LAYOUT / TOUCH

Mobile-first.

44px minimum touch targets.

Consistent spacing scale (8/12/16/24).

Cards: clean, solid, minimal, high contrast.

D) MOTION

Subtle motion only:

Feed transitions, button press feedback, count-up animations.

No heavy animations.

CORE EXPERIENCE (THE “ONE FLOW”)

Yollr has ONE continuous flow, like TikTok:

Home Feed is the hub.

YoBeast expands into detail/submit/vote/finale/reel.

Polls open as overlays/sheets.

Moments capture is a modal/route that returns you to feed instantly.

After every action, the user is smoothly returned to the feed.

“THREE APPS IN ONE” RULE (HOW TO IMPLEMENT WITHOUT FEELING SEGREGATED)

Poll interaction feels like GAS (fast overlay, one tap, instant result, back to feed).

Moment capture feels like BeReal (quick capture flow, minimal steps, return to feed).

YoBeast feels like MrBeast (weekly structure, hype, Saturday finale, winner reveal).
But visually + behaviorally they must share:

same header style

same spacing

same card shape

same CTA style

same typography

same state indicators

YOBeast WEEKLY STRUCTURE (EVENT MACHINE)

YoBeast is pre-designed by Yollr team (NOT student-designed). Students participate through:

submissions (optional depending on game type),

voting,

watch party finale,

sharing,

posting Moments around the game.

Weekly cadence (example):

Mon: Reveal trailer + rules + prize + sponsor

Tue–Wed: Submissions / qualifiers (game dependent)

Thu–Fri: Voting / eliminations

Sat: Campus watch party finale + winner reveal + rewards

Sun: Cooldown / recap / “Reel of the Week” + rest day

SPONSOR ANGLE (LOCAL BUSINESSES)

Sponsors pay weekly for:

campus-wide attention,

“moment capture” content,

branded prize placement,

measurable engagement (votes, shares, attendance intent).

You must implement sponsor fields in YoBeastWeek:

sponsor_name, logo_url, prize_text, redemption_instructions, sponsor_cta_url

SAFETY GUARDRAILS (BAKED INTO GAME)

Every YoBeast game must enforce guardrails:

legal & safe

on-campus or <10 min walk

under 2 hours

<=200 participants

sponsor tag included

At minimum:

show these rules in YoBeast detail

require a checkbox before submissions (if submissions exist)

add report flow on clips/moments

MYSTERY BOX (TikTok gifts energy — but safe)

Implement “Mystery Box” rewards as a lightweight, fun layer:

users earn boxes via actions (vote streaks, shares, participation)

opening a box yields: XP, badge, cosmetic effect, sponsor coupon, etc.

it must not bloat the core flow (no separate menus). Use feed nudges + a small modal.

TECH STACK (PRODUCTION — NO MOCKS)

Next.js App Router

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Clerk for auth (real sessions)

Supabase Postgres + Storage + Realtime (real persistent data)

No local JSON mocks, no fake users, no stub databases.

AUTH REQUIREMENTS (PROGRESSIVE ONBOARDING)

We still do progressive onboarding even with real auth:

User can browse limited feed preview before full signup (SEO/share pages).

Signup/login is required to vote or post.

Profile completion (username/avatar/campus year) can be deferred until after first “fun” action, but must be enforced before posting Moments or submitting YoBeast content.

CAMPUS AUTO-DETECTION + ZIP SEEDING (AUTOMATED)

On first run, request location permission.

Determine user ZIP / region.

Auto-suggest nearby campuses (HS + university).

User selects campus (required).

Campus list MUST come from an automated source (API or dataset), not hardcoded arrays.

Store campus in Supabase, tie user to campus_id.

All content is campus-isolated (RLS enforced).

SEO + SHAREABLE LINKS

Each YoBeast week, clip, poll, and moment must have a shareable URL.

Share pages must render meta tags (title/description/image).

Share pages should show a preview + install/signup CTA.

THE YOBeast DESIGN TEMPLATE SYSTEM (REQUIRED)

Create a reusable YoBeast Template System that ensures every weekly game ships with consistent UI and flow.

It is NOT an auto game generator. It is a structured “weekly config → UI + states” system.

You must implement:

Central config hub for weekly game definition (versioned objects stored in DB + optional repo file mirrors)

Modular components with TypeScript-enforced constraints:

every game uses the same layout skeleton

only allowed slots vary (title, steps, prize, phase, CTA labels, clip rules)

Validation pipeline (runtime + build-time checks):

fail fast if weekly config is missing required fields

Real-time preview in dev

npm run dev shows the current week game in all phases

State machine-driven UI

phases drive what users see (reveal/submissions/voting/finale/cooldown)

Template documentation

how to add/edit a weekly game safely

Audit trail + rollback

store weekly config versions, timestamps, publish status, rollback option

BUILD STRATEGY (DO NOT OVERWHELM YOURSELF)

Implement in 4 deliverable milestones. Each milestone must produce running code.

Milestone 1 — DESIGN SYSTEM + FEED FLOW FIRST (MOST IMPORTANT)

Goal: The app instantly feels like GAS/TikTok: clean, fast, unified.

Build the design tokens + Tailwind theme

Build Home Feed (single vertical)

Build card system (YoBeastCard, PollCard, MomentCard)

Build overlays (Poll overlay, lightweight MysteryBox modal)

Ensure no tab nav appears anywhere

Milestone 2 — AUTH + CAMPUS SEEDING + REAL DATA

Goal: Real users, real campus isolation, real persistence.

Clerk integration

Supabase schema + RLS

campus auto-detection and campus selection

feed loads real content for that campus

Milestone 3 — YoBeast Weekly Engine + Template System

Goal: The weekly spectacle flow works end-to-end.

YoBeastWeek config model + state machine

phases and routes: detail, submit (optional), vote, finale, reel

watch party states (lobby → live vote → reveal)

audit trail + rollback

Milestone 4 — Moments Capture + Sharing + Sponsor Layer

Goal: BeReal capture + viral loop + sponsor value.

moment capture flow (fast)

tie moments to YoBeast week

share templates + OG meta + attribution tracking

sponsor surfaces and redemption instructions

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

For the next response, you must do:

Ask me which milestone to implement first ONLY if not clear.

Otherwise begin with Milestone 1 automatically.

Provide:

file tree

full code for every file changed/added

no ellipses, no “TODO”, no placeholders

Keep files small and composable.

Every screen must preserve the ONE FLOW principle.

IMPORTANT: VISUAL QA CHECKLIST (YOU MUST SELF-AUDIT)

Before finishing each milestone, verify:

Does it feel like one continuous app flow, not routes/features?

Are CTAs consistent?

Are colors solid and consistent?

Is typography consistent?

Do overlays return you to feed smoothly?

Is the feed the main hub?

Is it fast and not bloated?

BEGIN

Start implementing Milestone 1 now. The priority is: flow + design + color correctness above all else.

If you want, I can also generate a separate “Milestone 1 UI acceptance checklist” you can hand to your UI/UX engineer so they can confirm the app matches GAS-like flow + the Pantone-inspired solid palette everywhere.

yes. I want real pantone 2025 color pallet for social medai apps. name the colors along with hex

Got it — real, solid, Pantone-aligned 2025/26 colors suitable for SOCIAL + MOBILE APPS, not fashion gradients, not experimental art palettes.

Below is a clean, usable, Gen-Z-appropriate DIGITAL interpretation of Pantone’s 2025 direction (Pantone does not release “hex for apps” officially, so this is how top product teams translate it for UI).

I’m giving you:

Color name (brandable)

Pantone reference direction

Production-safe HEX
